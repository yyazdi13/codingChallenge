* An ‘in shuffle’ is a perfect shuffle on a standard deck of 52 playing cards
that splits the deck in half, then interleaves cards starting with the top
half.
 
* What is the position of the first card after the 7th shuffle?

*       if we represent the deck as an array,
        the first element will move to index 21 (see line 52)

* How many times must one perform the shuffle so that the top card becomes
the bottom card?

*       it will take at least 25 shuffles (see line 45)

* When do the first and last cards in the deck touch?
*       it will take about 24 shuffles (see line 48)*/
